## 🎬 Observed Grief Expression (Cultural Reference, July 2025)

In July 2025, a short-form video on Chinese social media documented a pet owner's emotional and ritual journey following the sudden loss of her dog. The video gained significant resonance—over 17,000 likes and 8,500 shares within 24 hours—demonstrating widespread public identification with its themes.

While not a formal interview or participant study, the video offered a culturally embedded testimony of how people navigate pet loss. The following insights were distilled from the observed content and have directly informed the emotional system design of *Cloudtail*.

## 1. Design-Relevant Observations

### 🕊️ Ritual Preparation Under Stress
- The pet owner's grief was shaped by a sense of unpreparedness: she felt many things “could have been handled better” but were missed due to emotional numbness.
- She expressed regret over not making clearer decisions around memorial actions such as fur clipping, photo selection, and funeral pacing.

### 🪞 Symbolic Customisation
- The video featured a customised urn shaped like the dog, alongside hand-picked inscriptions, memorial plaques, and chosen fur segments—indicating a desire to "curate" grief.
- Grief was expressed symbolically through object selection, not just spoken reflection.

### 🌫️ Emotional Delay & Layering
- “The funeral was not the end... from that day on, grief truly began.” The pet owner described how sadness surfaced after all rituals had ended.
- Her emotions were mixed—describing both laughter and tears, lightness and heaviness, in post-ritual days.

## 2. Implications for System Design

### 🌐 Emotional Timing & Pacing
- *Cloudtail* integrates soft pacing loops: rituals are not endpoints but transitions.
- The system allows delayed grief to surface through symbolic repetition, ambient feedback, and optional re-engagement.

### 🧩 Symbolic Mechanics
- Players select symbolic objects (e.g. memory fragments, crafted items) representing fur, photos, or memories.
- Emotional artefacts are designed for placement, not linear achievement—reflecting how symbolic mourning works beyond “completion”.

### 🧑‍🚀 Pronoun Freedom & Narrative Voice
- The system allows users to choose narrative voice (he/she/they/it) when referring to their lost pet, supporting non-humanised or fluid relationships.
- This flexibility addresses emotional ambiguity and the varied roles pets may occupy.

## 3. Mapping Observations to Modules

| Observation                           | Cloudtail Mapping                           |
|--------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|
| Regret from unprepared farewell      | Memory input pacing + soft looping          |
| Symbolic urn and photo selection     | Crafted Item + Memory Pattern system        |
| Post-ritual sadness begins grief     | Planet feedback loop after rituals          |
| Fur, plaque, inscription as tokens   | Symbolic memory anchoring in planet space   |

## 5. Supporting Theoretical Anchors

- Reflective Design~\cite{sengers2006reflective} — enables ambiguity and interpretive freedom
- Thanatosensitive HCI~\cite{massimi2011thanatosensitive} — advocates for ritual-aware emotional technology
- Disenfranchised Grief~\cite{cordaro2012petloss} — supports non-verbal, indirect grief expression
